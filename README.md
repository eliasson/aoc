# Advent of code

Solved a few of this years puzzles in Nim. This is my first serious attempt to use Nim so beware the code is most definitely not ideomatic Nim!

## Running

```fish
nim c -r 2021/day01/a.nim
```

# To build a optimized binary

```fish
nim compile --opt:speed -d:release 2021/day09/b.nim
time ./2021/day09/b
```
